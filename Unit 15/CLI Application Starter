#b. Create a script that uses a menu system to ask the user if they want to run the following:

#		1. Calculator (Note: /usr/bin/gnome-calculator)
#		2. Text Editor (Note: gedit)
#		3. Web Browser (Note: firefox)
#		4. Quit Menu

#c. Your menu must also display the current date and time in an appropriate format. The menu system should also handle incorrect entries appropriately.

#d. For your script, you will need to provide a screenshot showing your completed script run, and you will also need to submit it in a text file, along with this document.
