# c. Create a Python script with a function named ‘timeReporting’ that accepts one parameter value.  The parameter value will be an integer that is used for the time.sleep() method.

# d. Your function when called in the main portion of your script will need to print out, just like the following:

# The Current Date is: 10/01/2017
# The Current Time is: 08:00:00
# ***Insert pause here***
# The Current Date is: 10/01/2017
# The Current Time is: 08:00:05

# Provide a screenshot of your script’s output when run, and provide your code within this document copied and pasted from your file.

            print('The Current Time is: ' + now.strftime("%I:%M:%S:%p"))
            time.sleep(sleep)
