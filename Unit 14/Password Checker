# c. For your script you will need to get input from a user, which will ask them to enter a password to be reviewed.  This needs to be outside of your functions that you will create for your script.  You will be passing the value of the user’s password entered as a parameter value to your functions.

# d. You will be creating four separate functions, you will have one function that verifies whether the user’s password contains at least three digits.

# e. You will have one function that will verify that the user’s password contains at least three lower case characters.

# f. You will have one function that will verify that the user’s password contains at least three upper case characters.

# g. You will also have one function that will verify that the user’s password contains at least three special characters.

# h. If the user’s password that they entered does not meet the requirements of having 3 numbers, 3 lowercase, 3 uppercase, and 3 special characters, your script should tell them that the password they entered does not meet the minimum requirements.  It should also tell them the area that does not meet the requirement.  For example, if the user enters the password of 123qweASD!, the script should state that the password does not meet the requirement of having three special characters. If the password does meet all requirements the script should tell them, ‘The password entered meets all requirements!’

# i. For your script, you will need to provide a screenshot showing your completed script showing run with a password that meets all requirements and with a password that does not meet all requirements.  You will also need to submit your code within the Assignment Instructions, or in a text file when submitted.
